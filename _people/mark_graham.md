I am a Research Associate at KCL, interested in developing machine learning-based tools and pipelines that can be deployed in the clinic. I currently work on developing segmentation algorithms that are accurate, generalisable, and uncertainty-aware. Prior to KCL I did my PhD at UCL where I built tools to simulate MRI Physics, and worked at a startup building deep-learning models to analyse retinal images.
