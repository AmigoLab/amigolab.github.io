Medical imaging has driven the path of my studies in applied mathematics (Ecole Polytechnique) and biomedical engineering (ETH Zurich). After my PhD at UCL focusing on white matter hyperintensities segmentation and characterisation, I have decided to extend my research focusing on age-related vascular lesions and to look at relationships with risk factors and cognitive associations which is the current focus of my Alzheimer's Society Fellowship. I am particularly interested in the causality link between vascular damage and brain functioning linked through brain imaging and the location and characterisation of such lesions.
