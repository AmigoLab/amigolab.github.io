I work on developing image processing software for segmentation, super-resolution and registration that should be applied to hospital grade brain scans. The framework I use involves modelling the observed data in a statistical setting, defining a forward model, data likelihood and prior. This type of modelling have previously been shown to generalise well to handle a wide distribution of healthy neuroimaging data. The idea is that it should also be a good candidate to deal with its more heterogenic counterpart -- images that can be found in hosptial databases.
