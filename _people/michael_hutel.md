Michael Hütel started his research career as a Research Assistant in the Brain Networks Group at the Max Planck Institute for Human and Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig where he studied the functional wiring of the human brain during rest using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. He continued pursuing this research interest during his PhD at the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), part of University College London, where he studied changes in the functional organisation of the human brain in pre-term born adults and young-onset Alzheimer disease patients under the supervision of Prof. Sebastien Ourselin. From August 2018, he joined the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences (BMEIS) where he conducted MR scanning and supervision of a mental imaginary study (MIND trial) in which a cohort of surgical trainees performed mental imaginary training and underwent several task and resting-state experiment scanning over the course of several months.
From October 2019, he joined the team of Thames Mammography (part of the London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value-Based Healthcare) as co-founder and CTO. His current research interests comprise of Deep Learning for object detection and classification, probabilistic matrix factorisation and Gaussian processes applied to medical imaging and health records.
