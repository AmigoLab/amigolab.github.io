Michael Hütel is a seasoned technologist who brings extensive experience from diverse roles to his current position. His work with industry leader IBM laid a strong foundation for his technical skills and industry insight. This was followed by Michael joining the Brain Networks Group at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig. There, he utilized Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to explore the functional wiring of the brain during rest. Building on this fascination with brain function and cognitive science, Michael pursued his PhD at the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) at University College London. He researched changes in functional brain  organization in pre-term born adults and young-onset Alzheimer's disease patients, furthering his commitment to understanding complex cognitive processes. In 2018, Michael expanded his scope of work by joining the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences (BMEIS). This position provided a broader perspective on the role of technology in healthcare and biomedical research, reinforcing his interest in applying technology for healthcare improvement. The culmination of his expertise in healthcare technology led Michael to co-found Elaitra in 2019. As the CTO, he applies his deep understanding of technology to drive innovations in breast screening workflow. Michael's approach of continuous improvement and measured disruption seeks to enhance the process of breast screening, aiming to improve detection accuracy, and ultimately save lives. His blend of tech industry experience, academic research, and dedication to healthcare disruption forms a unique strength as he works to transform the healthcare industry.
