My name is Kerstin Klaser and I am originally from Cologne, Germany. I did both my BSc and MSc in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Lübeck. I gained my interest in combined PET/MRI during my Master's project which was carried out at the University of Sydney. I then started my PhD on MR to CT synthesis with the objective to improve attenuation correction for PET/MRI in London. My main research interests include image-to-image translation, reinforcement learning and developnig techniques that can be translated into clinic.
