My research interests revolve around the problem of federated learning in hospital environments and, more precisely, medical imaging AI. Now, I aim to explore differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and distributed governance models for federated learning systems. Much of my previous work was focused on the integration of blockchain technologies in different application areas such as cryptocurrencies, IoT devices, fog computing, 5G, and distributed oracles. I had introduced dynamic and adaptive device-centric application execution models in edge-cloud-enabled IoT systems. I had also explored several problems related to distributed computing, big data reduction, reputation systems, federated learning, big/mobile/IoT data analytics, and IoT security.
